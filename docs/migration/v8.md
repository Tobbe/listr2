## Migration

- Error collection mechanism now is a boolean value since it is using `structuredClone` instead of an external library. You can read more about [here](http://localhost:5173/task/error-handling.html#modes).
- The minimum supported `node` version is now `v18.0.0` since older versions are marked as end-of-life.
