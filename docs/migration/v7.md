## Migration

::: warning

If you encounter any more of the breaking changes, please feel free to contribute by editing this page.

:::

- _Listr_ options `disableColor` and `forceColor` have been removed since they were not working as intended. Users are encouraged to use underlying environment variables for [colorrette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colorette), which are `FORCE_COLOR` and `NO_COLOR`.
- Environment variable `LISTR_DISABLE_COLOR` has been removed in favor of using the underlying library's `NO_COLOR` option instead to have consistency with other libraries.
