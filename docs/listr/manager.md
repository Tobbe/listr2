[Manager](/api/classes/listr2_manager.Manager.html) is a great way to create a custom-tailored _Listr_ class once and then utilize it more than once.

## Idea

The idea of having an additional task manager is to create a higher-order factory to create _Listr_ on demand with always your options. This allows you to not store your options as variables that you inject every time you create a new _Listr_ but store it in a stateful Manager where you can initiate as many _Listr_ task lists as you want.

It can alternatively be used as a single-task list for ongoing actions where you can add more tasks as you like. This is also possible through _Listr_ but not as convenient to do.
