Contributions are very welcome in this repository, there is no need to be toxic about anything, and everything is open to discussion. This includes but is not limited to **features, requests, bugs, and even help requests**! Nothing will mostly go stale unless there are some technical limitations/blockers, but it might take time due to **life**.

## State of Open-Source

Open source takes time and nobody should cry about something that is a personal choice, but we all know that if anybody ever complains about it is because of **toxicity**. Please be kind to anybody that provides you with a library, application, and lots of documentation free of charge, this is how the community progresses forward.

## Contributions are Welcome!

Contributions from all skill levels of fellow programmers are **welcome**.

You can always propose a new feature or a bug request and improve documentation, examples, or tests. There are no strict guidelines for contributing but following the [general ones](/repository/contributions.html) would force consistency.

## Donations are Welcome!

Even though I know nobody even cares, and this library is mostly hidden in tools that you use on a day-to-day basis, **this is mostly a one man show, and donations are always welcome through the provided sponsor links**.
